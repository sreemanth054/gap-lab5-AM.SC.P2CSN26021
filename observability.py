"""
observability.py - how every model call gets written down.

Supplied with Lab 5. You MAY edit this file, and you will have to edit the
two price constants below. You may add fields, helpers and extra functions.
You may NOT rename or remove any of the nine keys that log_call writes,
because the marking script reads them by name.

You must be able to explain every line of this file.

WHAT IT WRITES
    run_log.jsonl in the repository root. One JSON object per line, appended,
    never rewritten. One line per MODEL CALL, not per run. A retry is its own
    line. Lines from the same run of main.py share one run_id.

THE NINE KEYS
    timestamp          string   ISO 8601, UTC
    run_id             string   shared by every call in one run
    model              string   the model name actually used
    status             string   ok | invalid_output | refused | error
    prompt_tokens      int      tokens sent, measured or estimated
    completion_tokens  int      tokens returned, measured or estimated
    latency_ms         int      wall-clock time around the call
    cost_usd           float    computed by you, never reported by a provider
    tokens_estimated   bool     true if the two token counts are your estimate

UNKNOWN IS null, NOT 0
    Zero is a measurement. null is an absence. If a call raised before any
    reply came back, pass None for the token counts and the cost. Do not
    pass 0 to tidy the line up.
